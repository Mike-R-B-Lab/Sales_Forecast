# Sales Forecast

This project involved analyzing 8,763 products, ranging from snacks to health products, with 12 characteristics. This sales data was from various stores of different sizes located in different neighborhoods. The goal was to create a regression model that could predict sales for any new product in any store, even if the store was new. Here were the steps :

 - Data overview
 - Univariate Analysis
 - Bivariate Analysis
 - Feature Engineering
 - Outlier Check
 - Data preparation for modeling
 - Check for Multicollinearity
 - Building Models
 - Dropping insignificant variables
 - Statistical model validation

The final regression model explained approximately 79% of the variation in each product's sales.

While the model doesn't account for factors like marketing and store placement, it can serve as a great starting point for estimating sales of potential new products
